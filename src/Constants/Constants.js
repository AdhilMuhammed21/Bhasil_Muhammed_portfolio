      My journey has been one of chasing aspirations and fueling ambitions.
      It all began with a relentless pursuit of knowledge, reflected in my multiple qualifications for the UPSC Civil Services interview.
      However, the entrepreneurial spirit within me took hold, and I embarked on a new path.<br />
      Civils360 IAS Academy became my canvas, where I poured my experience and passion into training the next generation of civil servants.<br />
      Witnessing my students become the future leaders of our nation is an immensely rewarding experience.
      Beyond the professional realm, I am a dedicated entrepreneur, constantly seeking new avenues for growth and development.<br />
      But when I'm not strategizing or mentoring, you'll likely find me exploring new destinations, a testament to my love for travel.
      This website is a culmination of these passions - a space to share not only my knowledge and experience but also my enthusiasm for learning and exploration.<br />
      So, whether you're an aspiring civil servant seeking guidance or simply someone who shares a love for adventure, welcome aboard!
